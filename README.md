# FoodFest- A Swiggy Clone Web App 🍔🚀

FoodFest is my own project that's like the well-known Swiggy food delivery app. I made this web app using React, Parcel to bundle things up, Tailwind CSS for styling, Redux Toolkit for handling the app's state. It uses advanced React concepts to make it interactive and easy for users.


## Features 🌟

- **User Location Detection:** The app uses GPS to find out where you are and shows you nearby restaurants based on your location.

- **Restaurant Sorting:** Users can organize the list of restaurants by delivery time, price (from low to high or high to low), ratings, or just the default order.

- **Restaurant Details:** Take a closer look at each restaurant and see what dishes they have on their menu.

- **Cart Management:** Add items to your cart as you check out different restaurants. When you're ready, go to the cart page to see a summary of your order.

- **Dynamic Location Change:** User can switch up location on the go! Use a search feature to find restaurants in different areas whenever you want.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **React:** The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **Parcel:** Parcel is used as the bundler, simplifying the setup and build process of the application.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS is employed for styling the app, allowing for efficient and customizable styling using utility classes.

- **Redux Toolkit:** Redux Toolkit is used for state management, providing a standardized way to manage and update the application's state.

## Advanced React Concepts 🚀

- **Custom Hooks:** The app utilizes custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse logic, improving code organization and reusability.

- **Context API:** The Context API is employed to manage and share state across components without excessive prop drilling.

- **React Portals:** React portals are used to render modals and overlays, providing a better user experience for certain interactions.
